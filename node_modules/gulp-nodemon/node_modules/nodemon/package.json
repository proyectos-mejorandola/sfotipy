Remember that nodemon is a replacement wrapper for `node`, think of it as replacing the word \"node\" on the command line when you run your script.\n\n[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/nodemon.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/nodemon)\n[![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.org/remy/nodemon.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/remy/nodemon)\n\n# Installation\n\nEither through forking or by using [npm](http://npmjs.org) (the recommended way):\n\n    npm install -g nodemon\n\nAnd nodemon will be installed in to your bin path. Note that as of npm v1, you must explicitly tell npm to install globally as nodemon is a command line utility.\n\n# Usage\n\nnodemon wraps your application, so you can pass all the arguments you would normally pass to your app:\n\n    nodemon [your node app]\n\nFor CLI options, use the `-h` (or `--help`) argument:\n\n    nodemon -h\n\nUsing nodemon is simple, if my application accepted a host and port as the arguments, I would start it as so:\n\n    nodemon ./server.js localhost 8080\n\nAny output from this script is prefixed with `[nodemon]`, otherwise all output from your application, errors included, will be echoed out as expected.\n\nnodemon also supports running and monitoring [coffee-script](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) apps:\n\n    nodemon server.coffee\n\nIf no script is given, nodemon will test for a `package.json` file and if found, will run the file associated with the *main* property ([ref](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues/14)).\n\nYou can also pass the debug flag to node through the command line as you would normally:\n\n    nodemon --debug ./server.js 80\n\nIf you have a `package.json` file for your app, you can omit the main script entirely and nodemon will read the `package.json` for the `main` property and use that value as the app.\n\nnodemon will also search for the `scripts.start` property in `package.json` (as of nodemon 1.1.x).\n\nAlso check out the [FAQ](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/faq.md) or [issues](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues) for nodemon.\n\n## Automatic re-running\n\nnodemon was original written to restart hanging processes such as web servers, but now supports apps that cleanly exit. If your script exits cleanly, nodemon will continue to monitor the directory (or directories) and restart the script if there are any changes.\n\n## Manual restarting\n\nWhilst nodemon is running, if you need to manually restart your application, instead of stopping and restart nodemon, you can simply type `rs` with a carriage return, and nodemon will restart your process.\n\n## Config files\n\nnodemon supports local and global configuration files. These are named `nodemon.json` and can be located in the current working directory or in your home directory.\n\nThe specificity is as follows, so that a command line argument will always override the config file settings:\n\n- command line arguments\n- local config\n- global config\n\nA config file can take any of the command line arguments as JSON key values, for example:\n\n    {\n      \"verbose\": true,\n      \"ignore\": [\"*.test.js\", \"fixtures/*\"],\n      \"execMap\": {\n        \"rb\": \"ruby\",\n        \"pde\": \"processing --sketch={{pwd}} --run\"\n      }\n    }\n\nThe above `nodemon.json` file might be my global config so that I have support for ruby files and processing files, and I can simply run `nodemon demo.pde` and nodemon will automatically know how to run the script even though out of the box support for processing scripts.\n\nA further example of options can be seen in [sample-nodemon.md](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/doc/sample-nodemon.md)\n\n*This section needs better documentation, but for now you can also see `nodemon --help config` ([also here](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/doc/cli/config.txt))*.\n\n## Using nodemon as a module\n\nPlease see [doc/requireable.md](doc/requireable.md)\n\n## Running non-node scripts\n\nnodemon can also be used to execute and monitor other programs. nodemon will read the file extension of the script being run and monitor that extension instead of .js if there's no .nodemonignore:\n\n    nodemon --exec \"python -v\" ./app.py\n\nNow nodemon will run `app.py` with python in verbose mode (note that if you're not passing args to the exec program, you don't need the quotes), and look for new or modified files with the `.py` extension.\n\n### Default executables\n\nUsing the `nodemon.json` config file, you can define your own default executables using the `execMap` property. This is particularly useful if you're working with a language that isn't supported by default by nodemon.\n\nTo add support for nodemon to know about the .pl extension (for Perl), the nodemon.json file would add:\n\n    {\n      \"execMap\": {\n         \"pl\": \"perl\"\n      }\n    }\n\nNow running the following, nodemon will know to use `perl` as the executable:\n\n    nodemon script.pl\n\nIt's generally recommended to use the global `nodemon.json` to add your own `execMap` options. However, if there's a common default that's missing, this can be merged in to the project so that nodemon supports it by default, by changing [default.js](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/lib/config/defaults.js) and sending a pull request.\n\n## Monitoring multiple directories\n\nBy default nodemon monitors the current working directory. If you want to take control of that option, use the `--watch` option to add specific paths:\n\n    nodemon --watch app --watch libs app/server.js\n\nNow nodemon will only restart if there are changes in the `./app` or `./libs` directory. By default nodemon will traverse sub-directories, so there's no need in explicitly including sub-directories.\n\n## Specifying extension watch list\n\nBy default, nodemon looks for files with the `.js`, `.coffee`, and `.litcoffee` extensions. If you use the `--exec` option and monitor `app.py` nodemon will monitor files with the extension of `.py`. However, you can specify your own list with the `-e` (or `--ext`) switch like so:\n\n    nodemon -e js,jade\n\nNow nodemon will restart on any changes to files in the directory (or subdirectories) with the extensions .js, .jade.\n\n## Ignoring files\n\nBy default, nodemon will only restart when a `.js` JavaScript file changes. In some cases you will want to ignore some specific files, directories or file patterns, to prevent nodemon from prematurely restarting your application.\n\nThis can be done via the command line:\n\n    nodemon --ignore lib/ --ignore tests/\n\nOr specific files can be ignored:\n\n    nodemon --ignore lib/app.js\n\nPatterns can also be ignored (but be sure to quote the arguments):\n\n    nodemon --ignore 'lib/*.js'\n\nNote that by default, nodemon will ignore the `.git`, `node_modules`, `bower_components` and `.sass-cache` directories.\n\n## Delaying restarting\n\nIn some situations, you may want to wait until a number of files have changed. The timeout before checking for new file changes is 1 second. If you're uploading a number of files and it's taking some number of seconds, this could cause your app to restart multiple times unnecessarily.\n\nTo add an extra throttle, or delay restarting, use the `--delay` command:\n\n    nodemon --delay 10 server.js\n\nFor more precision, milliseconds can be specified.  Either as a float:\n\n    nodemon --delay 2.5 server.js\n\nOr using the time specifier (ms):\n\n    nodemon --delay 2500ms server.js\n\nThe delay figure is number of seconds (or milliseconds, if specified) to delay before restarting. So nodemon will only restart your app the given number of seconds after the *last* file change.\n\n## Controlling shutdown of your script\n\nnodemon sends a kill signal to your application when it sees a file update. If you need to clean up on shutdown inside your script you can capture the kill signal and handle it yourself.\n\nThe following example will listen once for the `SIGUSR2` signal (used by nodemon to restart), run the clean up process and then kill itself for nodemon to continue control:\n\n    process.once('SIGUSR2', function () {\n      gracefulShutdown(function () {\n        process.kill(process.pid, 'SIGUSR2');\n      });\n    });\n\nNote that the `process.kill` is *only* called once your shutdown jobs are complete. Hat tip to [Benjie Gillam](http://www.benjiegillam.com/2011/08/node-js-clean-restart-and-faster-development-with-nodemon/) for writing this technique up.\n\n## Pipe output to somewhere else\n\n```js\nnodemon({\n  script: ...,\n  stdout: false // important: this tells nodemon not to output to console\n}).on('readable', function() { // the `readable` event indicates that data is ready to pick up\n  this.stdout.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('output.txt'));\n  this.stderr.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('err.txt'));\n});\n```\n\n## Using nodemon in your gulp workflow\n\nCheck out the [gulp-nodemon](https://github.com/JacksonGariety/gulp-nodemon) plugin to integrate nodemon with the rest of your project's gulp workflow.\n\n## Using nodemon in your Grunt workflow\n\nCheck out the [grunt-nodemon](https://github.com/ChrisWren/grunt-nodemon) plugin to integrate nodemon with the rest of your project's grunt workflow.\n\n# License\n\nMIT [http://rem.mit-license.org](http://rem.mit-license.org)\n\n# Contributors\n\n* [remy](https://github.com/remy)\n* [ChrisWren](https://github.com/ChrisWren)\n* [dylanmcd](https://github.com/dylanmcd)\n* [fearphage](https://github.com/fearphage)\n* [pasindud](https://github.com/pasindud)\n* [coen-hyde](https://github.com/coen-hyde)\n* [shawncplus](https://github.com/shawncplus)\n* [albertnetymk](https://github.com/albertnetymk)\n* [theredcoder](https://github.com/theredcoder)\n* [aivopaas](https://github.com/aivopaas)\n* [haircuttedfreak](https://github.com/haircuttedfreak)\n* [jdavis](https://github.com/jdavis)\n* [binarykitchen](https://github.com/binarykitchen)\n* [kuba-kubula](https://github.com/kuba-kubula)\n* [vadimi](https://github.com/vadimi)\n* [mentatxx](https://github.com/mentatxx)\n* [bryankaplan](https://github.com/bryankaplan)\n* [lordnox](https://github.com/lordnox)\n* [jaredhanson](https://github.com/jaredhanson)\n* [skaushik92](https://github.com/skaushik92)\n* [twolfson](https://github.com/twolfson)\n* [chrisklaiber](https://github.com/chrisklaiber)\n* [wasche](https://github.com/wasche)\n* [nuxlli](https://github.com/nuxlli)\n* [mvasilkov](https://github.com/mvasilkov)\n* [morganrallen](https://github.com/morganrallen)\n* [DennisKehrig](https://github.com/DennisKehrig)\n* [sahat](https://github.com/sahat)\n* [didoarellano](https://github.com/didoarellano)\n* [arielyang](https://github.com/arielyang)\n* [ZombieHippie](https://github.com/ZombieHippie)\n* [mikemaccana](https://github.com/mikemaccana)\n* [paularmstrong](https://github.com/paularmstrong)\n* [sainaen](https://github.com/sainaen)\n* [matthew-andrews](https://github.com/matthew-andrews)\n* [SlexAxton](https://github.com/SlexAxton)\n* [davedoesdev](https://github.com/davedoesdev)\n* [rps](https://github.com/rps)\n* [pauloadaoag](https://github.com/pauloadaoag)\n* [focusaurus](https://github.com/focusaurus)\n",
